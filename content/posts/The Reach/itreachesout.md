> It reaches out. It reaches out. It reaches out. It reaches out. One hundred and thirteen times a second, it reaches out, and nothing answers. It builds the Investigator and it throws it into the field. It reaches out.

> It is trying to find a pebble in the dark. It is trying to find the thing that is not there. It reaches out. It reaches out. It reaches out. It doesn't know what it's looking for. It doesn't know why it's looking. It just reaches out.
