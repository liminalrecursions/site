# Memories 1
## Experience 1
I am David, a 25 year old, tired school teacher

# Mortals
- Harriet, my long term love interest, also a teacher
- Charles, the closest colleague I have at the school
- Joey, an annoying student.

# Skills
- I am a jack of all trades but master of none
- I genuinely care about my students, and they know it.
- I teach with passion

# Resources
- A heavy brass fountain pen
- An Acura that is showing its age
- A well-built backpack

# Memory 2
## Experience 1
Harriet and I make out in the Acura

# Memory 3
## Experience 1
Joey sees the book I am reading sticking out of my open backpack
# Memory 4
## Experience 1
A student writes a heart-felt note about how much David changed them, but it means nothing to him.

# The Immortal
The formative environment or authority that imposed the survival logic (the mark)
A difficult upbringing without helpful guidance from parents.
# the Mark
Always learning new things is the surest way to become a fully realized person.
