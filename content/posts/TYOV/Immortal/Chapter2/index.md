Exactly twenty-three years after the affliction, Master Edmonstone's castle became my castle. 

To those in town, rumors spread that Lottie Edmonstone suffered hysteria and reclusion. Lack of a proper husband and children. She reportedly never left her grounds.  Never leaving. Never socialising. She used to throw such extravagant banquets, they would say. She served her town well, they would say. Protected us. But she and everyone else in the castle served me. 
I learned fairly quickly that my skills as an negotiator had... flourished. I didn't even have to look others in the eyes. In passing I could ask someone to fetch me a spoon and I'd have everyone in the room bringing metal over. I barely had to speak. It was like they were drawn to me... compelled to listen. It didn't matter what I was saying, either. The first time I realized this was happening, I was sharing the recipe for a lamb stew I had come up with. I first thought that Master Edmonstone, Lottie, only really liked it. But staring so intently in my eyes as i told her how it was pre-roasting the lamb over a spit, sticking lard, not butter, under the skin was the key to so much flavour in the final stew...

Without much effort, or, desire, really, I had the entire castle serving me like they had never served Lottie. 

One day from the kitchen I heard noises coming from the basement cellars. Carefully I stepped down to find out what was going on. From my spot on the stairs, I could see flickering candles littered all over the floor. The sound of chating was loud by this point. And there was a circle. Made of... salt. And what smelled like a mixture of grease and India Pepper.  There was a portrait of me that Lottie had commissioned some months earlier, resting on a pedestal inside the circle.And there they were. All of Lottie, I mean my, servants. Every one of them bare chested, men and women alike. No shame at all in their eyes. It was all so incomprehensible, but almost as though they had been reheasing this for some time so perfect were their movements, so in sync their voices. I could hardly look away. And, Lottie was there too. It seemed as though she was leading them. Acting as some kind of twisted conductor as she moved around the circle.

As the chants continued into a reverie, I witnessed one of the servants pick a candle from the floor, step over the spices, and enter the circle. Then, while looking squarely at my portrait, they lifted their candle over their head with two hands and tipped it towards themselves so that the hot wax poured and dripped onto their chest. The chanting got louder then, for a moment. But it wasn't done. The servant quickly put down the candle around my portrait, moved to the edge of the circle, picked up a small handful of spice, and rubbed it into the hot wax, creating a paste of salt and spice that adhered right to their skin.

One by one they each took their turn, returning to the circle afterward. Last, of course, was Lottie. She had an expression on her face as though she knew everyone was watching her, watching her example. If she couldn't be leader of her house, she could at least still lead here, in some small way. The determination was evident on her face even from where I was crouched on the stairs. As she rubbed the hot wax and spice into her chest, staring deeply at my portrait, then reached out and touched it. The chanting stopped. Everyone stopped. She said, it is done.

In that moment I fled, as quietly as I could, back up the stairs, before they donned their clothes and went back to their station.
