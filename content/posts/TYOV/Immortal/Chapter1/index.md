*A loved one discovers your condition and works
to help you. Create a Resource which represents
their assistance. Create a mortal Character if
none are available.*

I was able to stumble my way back from India to Scotland over the course of several weeks and many blackout events. Glen was the first to notice the changes. I returned with less confidence, a certain dread always lingering. He couldn't determine a cause, but was quick to lance insults when I didn't seem to be myself, as is his way. Isbeil was more perceptive. Even in the kitchen, where smells of smoke and spice and rendering fat were always present, she smelled me. "You smell of a faint mixture of peat and cured meat from Spain... sulphurous even." I broke down then, told her everything. She never acted the same around me again, always scared, but would not absolve herself from her mother-in-absentia duties to Glen. She recommended a perfumer, described my predicament and crafted a fragrance he was sure that would mask my odour. It did not work, but it was a nice gesture.

*You murder someone you love or respect rather*
*than let them expose you. Kill a Character. Check*
*a Skill. If you have no living Characters, kill no*
*one and create a beloved mortal Character who*
*you have betrayed.*

It is done. I am... heavy-hearted. Ashamed, and do not know what to do with myself. 

The last decade has been trying, to out a fine point on it,  I have tried to adapt to my new life. Unwillingly, especially at first. I cannot see my son for more than a few minutes a week, I cannot explain to him why I must be awake all night. Even as a young man there are some aspects of this world he does not need to know. And anyway, he is busy with work. 

For many years, Isbeil had been supportive. She helped provide... explanations. Excuses, really. To everyone, but especially to Glen, when none were forthcoming from me. It was the illness, she would say. The one I contracted in India¸ of which never did fully heal, my still visible symptoms manifesting in a sensitivity to light, irritability, melancholia. Work in the kitchen carried on as usual for a time, with fewer pleasantries. It was possible to black out light from the windows. They were already so covered in soot and grease that it was not a labour to finish the job.

I locked myself in my room and starved myself intentionally, for the first month. Refused all visitors. I was ill. I couldn't be seen by anyone lest they catch what I was afflicted with. I took the food they left by the door so they didn't think I would die, but I never ate it. I couldn't. The sight of it made me sick. It only took a couple of days for me to covince myself that dying was the safest option, so I just did not eat. Instead of dying, I withered. Shriveled. It was excrutiating. I could not speak and could barely walk on my own feet. But I would not die. It was agony. After many weeks I came out of my room in the middle of the night, desperate for sustenance. Of course I was called to one thing and one thing only. 

I found a chicken in the roost. Used a pitchfork as best I could in my condition and managed to skewer it. I was both famished and disgusted by myself at the same time. The blood was so warm. Soothing. Like an elixir. I felt immediately invigorated.

From there, I began imbibing the blood of livestock about to be slaughtered for castle meals. I craved it to be fresh, warm. Isbeil was repulsed. At first, I was too. Many nights were spent languishing my own misfortune. 

But months later, having regained my strength and, dare I say it, even seemed more youthful, the metallic taste, the viscosity, the richness of it, and how I quickly was able to distinguish qualities. how it felt in my mouth, soon became all I craved. At some point, my hands began quivering each time I  butchered a beast and their blood would stain my arms.

Isbeil remained disgusted the whole time. In my behaviour. In who I was becoming. I felt more intelligent, more capable. Stronger. I have always been able to plan, banter, socialise, curry favour with, make deals to support my master. But now, it was though I could pinpoint weaknesses in those I was speaking with and manipulate those weaknesses to my advantage. 

Soon, animals were not enough. That is when my long long nightly walks started. 
 
Being a microcosm of the goings on of the town, word of the increase in disappearances quickly spread at the castle. In a town of any size, there will always be a proportion that go missing and are never found. But in ours, in recent years, it has... increased. 

Isbeil always suspected me. But she was always scared to bring it up. I could feel the fear in her now, the anger, the conflict. It resonated in her like the vibrations of a rung bell. Where she did always challenge me, was my stern refusal to tell Glen what had transpired. Why I had changed.  In the last year, Isbeil became bolder. Several times she presented me with an ultimatum. Either I tell Glen the truth, or she would. Always the mother. I've been able to felty maneuvre around all of them, quicker and smoother in my words than I have ever been. Until last night. After everyone else was in their quarters, she played her final card. She would be leaving the kitchen and visiting Glen, to tell him. 

She knew she was putting her life in jeopardy. Maybe our willingness to do so increases with the years. Maybe it is our folly. She raised her voice. I discovered the stake hidden in the knot of her apron. I do not know if she was planning to use offensively or defensively, but it was useless anyway. I grabbed her hand, used a knife to open a wound in her neck, and drank until there was nothing more to drink. It was over in what felt like minutes.

I have not felt so conflicted as I have since my wife passed while bearing Glen. I feel an energy, a vitality, coursing through me like nothing before. But I have never felt so alone.
