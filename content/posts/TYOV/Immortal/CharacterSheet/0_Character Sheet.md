| 1      | I am Niall, head chef at my master's castle in the highlands of Scotland, circa 15th Century.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 4      | Isbeil and I gossip about a love connection between a disgusting blacksmith and a maid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5      | I met the unsavoury Felix Pinnick in India, twice. One time, to bargain for saffron. The second, after an invite to a social gathering. He served me a cocktail mixed with his blood. Consuming it, I was changed. Before I lost consciousness, he grinned and told me I would suffer for crossing him. |
