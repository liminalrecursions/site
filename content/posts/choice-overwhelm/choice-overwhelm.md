# part 1: growing up
I was told, and likely many my age were told, that as long as you went to university, you could do anything you wanted to. Follow your heart. The world is open to you, kid.
It makes sense that this was the message shared; many boomer parents weren't able to go to university themselves, and the messaging of the time really was, university = success. Unfortunately, it stopped there. Very little structure, boundaries, help moving beyond the "you can do anything" rainbow was ever given.

Cue the introduction of the world wide web.
Provided too many options. the boundaries that didn't exist before grew infinitely larger.
